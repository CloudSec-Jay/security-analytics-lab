## 🎯 The Mission

**"Turning raw infrastructure logs and business data into actionable security and operational intelligence."**

## 💡 Why This Exists

In modern DevSecOps, data is the primary fuel for detection and response. This repository serves as my laboratory for mastering the tools and techniques required to analyze large-scale datasets, identify anomalies, and build predictive models. From analyzing global internet usage patterns to performing morphological analysis on skeletal data, this lab focuses on the core discipline of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and the transition into automated **MLOps** pipelines.

## 🗺️ Reorganization Logic

│   └── sql/            <-- Relational data queries and schema
└── README.md
```

## 🛠️ What It Does

This lab covers a diverse range of analytical domains using the Python data stack:

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraging `Pandas` and `NumPy` to clean, transform, and aggregate complex datasets such as global internet connectivity and demographic trends.
*   **Data Visualization:** Utilizing `Matplotlib` to create high-signal visual representations of data, including specialized projects like the Mondrian Art analysis.
*   **Statistical Modeling:** Applying mathematical principles to datasets like `skeletal_variation` to identify patterns and outliers.
*   **Relational Database Queries:** Using `SQL` to interface with structured data, simulating the backend of production analytical platforms.

## 📈 Business Impact

*   **Informed Decision Making:** Provides the methodology to move from "gut feeling" to data-backed evidence for infrastructure scaling and security posture.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Develops the skills necessary to identify statistical outliers in logs that represent 0-day attacks or system failures.
*   **Automation Readiness:** Prepares data for MLOps pipelines, reducing the time from data ingestion to model deployment by ensuring clean, structured inputs.

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

*   **Data Engineering:** Reorganizing and structuring multi-source datasets for high-performance analysis.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation, distribution analysis, and trend forecasting.
*   **Visualization:** Communicating complex technical findings through clear, scannable charts and graphs.
*   **SQL/NoSQL Proficiency:** Bridging the gap between raw data storage and analytical interfaces.

## ⚠️ Honest Limitations

*   **Data Volume:** Currently optimized for small-to-medium datasets (CSV-based) rather than Big Data frameworks (Spark/Hadoop).
*   **Model Depth:** Focuses primarily on EDA and statistical fundamentals; deep learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch) implementations are pending.
*   **Clean Room Isolation:** Notebooks are designed for local execution and require manual environment setup (Conda/Pip).

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Scikit-Learn Integration:** Implement baseline classification models for the `adult-human-skeleton` dataset.
- [ ] **Dashboarding:** Transition static visualizations into interactive `Streamlit` or `Plotly` dashboards.
- [ ] **Containerized Analysis:** Create Dockerized environments for reproducible notebook execution.
